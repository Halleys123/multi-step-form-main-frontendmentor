## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

There were a lot of new things to learn and revise what you studied earlier in this project as this project includes various aspects varying from HTML forms to javascript Validation.

Some of the few things I learnt and revised are:

- HTML forms
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox and its properties
- Javascript Validation - It includes validation of emails. I learnt how to validate emails using regular expressions.
- Javascript DOM Manipulation - I used DOM to make the form dynamic. I used DOM to change the content of the form.
- Javascript Event Listeners - I used event listeners to make the form dynamic. I used event listeners to change the content of the form.
- Using multiple classes for special selection of elements - I used multiple classes to select the elements that I wanted to change.
- Using the `:checked` pseudo-class - I used the `:checked` pseudo-class to select the checked radio buttons.
- Learnt a new way of using relative postioning
- Learnt that tranform and absolute positioning can't be used simontaneously as tranform creates a new coordinte system which obstructs porper positioning of elements.

### Continued development

I would like to change the formatting of javascript code and make it more readable. I would also like to make the code more efficient and reduce the number of lines of code.
