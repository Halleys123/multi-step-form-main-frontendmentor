## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

There were a lot of new things to learn and revise what you studied earlier in this project as this project includes various aspects varying from HTML forms to javascript Validation.

Some of the few things I learnt and revised are:

- HTML forms
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox and its properties
- Javascript Validation - It includes validation of emails. I learnt how to validate emails using regular expressions.
- Javascript DOM Manipulation - I used DOM to make the form dynamic. I used DOM to change the content of the form.
- Javascript Event Listeners - I used event listeners to make the form dynamic. I used event listeners to change the content of the form.
